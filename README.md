# The Sheldrake Arduino Template

An early prototype of a cross-platform implementation template of the [Sheldrake](https://github.com/m516/sheldrake) project. As of right now, the main source code implements LQR control on an inverted pendulum. It is designed to test the Sheldrake backend, implemented as a Platformio library.
